# xcl-servlet-engine
A lightweight, hand-crafted Java servlet container that simulates Tomcat’s core mechanisms — including HTTP request handling, web.xml-based servlet mapping, dynamic class loading, and multi-threaded request dispatching. Built from scratch using raw sockets, reflection, DOM4J, and the servlet lifecycle pattern.
